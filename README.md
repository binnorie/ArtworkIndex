# ArtworkIndex
For Dr. Monica Maceli's LIS 697-01 Database Design and Development class, taken in the Fall, 2016 at Pratt Institute's School of Information, I designed and implemented an art registry database meant to store and interpret data about artists, artworks, and intellectual property rights, for the purposes of providing research data, and authoritative support for legal disputes.
Initially proposed to index a digital asset management service, the database instead could potentially become an index for archived URLs for artwork published online.
